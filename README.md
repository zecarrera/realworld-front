# Mocking playwright API calls made easy with mockoon
This repo exemplifies the usage of [mockoon](https://mockoon.com/) as an easy and quick approach to mock the API calls that are made whilst testing the UI.

### Playwright UI tests

Under the `tests` directory you'll find the UI tests that have been implemented.

#### Running tests from the terminal:

1. Start application (`npm install && npm run dev`)
2. Start mockoon (through its UI or using `mockoon-cli start --data ./mockoon/RealWorldApi.json --port 9001`)
3. Run `npx playwright test`
   1. add `--ui` if you wish to run on headed mode.

#### GitHub Actions

Tests are configured to be automatically triggered once a PR is raised or code is pushed to the `main` branch.

The application code is a fork from  [RealWorld example app](salahadin-dinsafa/realworld-front) and its initial README is replicated below.


# [Next.js 14]

> ### Next.js 14 codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

## Getting started

You can view a live demo over at [https://realworld-tau.vercel.app/](https://realworld-tau.vercel.app/)

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start the local server

- add .env file at root directory
- Then add the following variable

  - COOKIE_NAME=%name of cookie%
  - COOKIE_PASSWORD=%password you want for cookie%
  - ++note COOKIE_PASSWORD length must be at least 32 character as it is described here https://www.npmjs.com/package/iron-session 
Password generated using -> https://1password.com/password-generator
 - you can change base url in respect of your backend application
  - BASE_URL=https://api.realworld.io/api

  your frontend application url NEXT_PUBLIC_RELATIVE_PATH example if your running on localhost
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_RELATIVE_PATH=http://localhost:3000/api



## Functionality overview

The example application is a social blogging site (i.e. a Medium.com clone) called "Conduit". It uses a custom API for all requests, including authentication. You can view a live demo over at [https://realworld-tau.vercel.app/](https://realworld-tau.vercel.app/)

**General functionality:**

- Authenticate users via JWT (login/register pages + logout button on settings page)
- CRU\* users (sign up & settings page - no deleting required)
- CRUD Articles
- CR\*D Comments on articles (no updating required)
- GET and display paginated lists of articles
- Favorite articles
- Follow other users

**The general page breakdown looks like this:**

- Home page (URL: /)
  - List of tags
  - List of articles pulled from either Feed, Global, or by Tag
  - Pagination for list of articles
- Sign in/Sign up pages (URL: /user/login, /user/register)
  - Use JWT (store the token in localStorage)
- Settings page (URL: /user/settings )
- Editor page to create/edit articles (URL: /editor/new, /editor/article-slug-here)
- Article page (URL: /article/article-slug-here)
  - Delete article button (only shown to article's author)
  - Render markdown from server client side
  - Comments section at bottom of page
  - Delete comment button (only shown to comment's author)
- Profile page (URL: /profile/username-here, /profile/username-here?favorite=true)
  - Show basic user info
  - List of articles populated from author's created articles or author's favorited articles
